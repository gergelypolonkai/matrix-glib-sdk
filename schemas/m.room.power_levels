If a ``user_id`` is in the ``users`` list, then that ``user_id`` has the associated power level. Otherwise they have the default level ``users_default``. If ``users_default`` is not supplied, it is assumed to be 0. The level required to send a certain event is governed by ``events``, ``state_default`` and ``events_default``. If an event type is specified in ``events``, then the user must have at least the level specified in order to send that event. If the event type is not supplied, it defaults to ``events_default`` for Message Events and ``state_default`` for State Events.",
