    "description": "Adjusts the membership state for a user in a room. It is preferable to use the membership APIs (``/rooms/<room id>/invite`` etc) when performing membership actions rather than adjusting the state directly as there are a restricted set of valid transformations. For example, user A cannot force user B to join a room, and trying to force this state change directly will fail. \n\nThe following membership states are specified:\n\n- ``invite`` - The user has been invited to join a room, but has not yet joined it. They may not participate in the room until they join.\n\n- ``join`` - The user has joined the room (possibly after accepting an invite), and may participate in it.\n\n- ``leave`` - The user was once joined to the room, but has since left (possibly by choice, or possibly by being kicked).\n\n- ``ban`` - The user has been banned from the room, and is no longer allowed to join it until they are un-banned from the room (by having their membership state set to a value other than ``ban``).\n\n- ``knock`` - This is a reserved word, which currently has no meaning.\n\nThe ``third_party_invite`` property will be set if this invite is an ``invite`` event and is the successor of an ``m.room.third_party_invite`` event, and absent otherwise.\n\nThis event may also include an ``invite_room_state`` key **outside the** ``content`` **key**. If present, this contains an array of ``StrippedState`` Events. These events provide information on a few select state events such as the room name.",
